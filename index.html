					<h2> ARTS </h2>
			 				<p> I grew up on the water; one of my first memories includes sailing at high speeds with my father and brother in the Baltic sea near our summer cabin and my two-year-old brother falling off the boat. My father dove in after him; this memory has sparked a passion for long days lounging on our family sailboat with my mother and a passion for exciting adventures through stormy weather with my father.

			 		<h2> SKIING </h2>
			 				<p>
							After reluctantly being put on skis at two years old and told to "go for it," I fell in love with the sport. Having skied in many different countries and landscapes, I have gained respect for the beauty and difficulty of the sport. Now at 19 years old, I haven't missed a skiing season yet.

			 			<h2> TRAVEL </h2>
			 				<p> 
			 				I have always had a passion for traveling. My love for exploring new places was sparked by my parents, instilling a sense of adventure in me from a young age. Growing up, my family vacations always included exploring new places, whether this was ziplining through tropical rainforests, getting lost in northern tundras, or cliff diving in the tropics. I could always count on a new adventure. Although now that I am no longer living with them, cheap travel and sacrifice are a necessity.
